# Privilege Escalation

These tools and methods were used in [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) challenges:

## [`pspy`](https://github.com/DominicBreuker/pspy)

pspy is a command line tool designed to snoop on processes without need for root permissions.
It allows you to see commands run by other users, cron jobs, etc. as they execute. Great for enumeration of Linux systems in CTFs
