# Payload

These payloads and Payloads generators were used in [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) challenges:

### [`ssti_payload_generator_java_springboot.py`](ssti_payload_generator_java_springboot.py)

a script that generate a SSTI Payload in Java for injection and filter bypassing, the challenge required us to use the `*{7*7}` instead of the usual `${7*7}` 
we can change the character depending of our needs

for the future, we can use 3 type of character to trigger SSTI `${7*7}` `#{7*7}` `*{7*7}`
